                                    My name is ambrose Tafang. I am originally from Cameroon, Central Africa. I reside in Overland Park with my wife and two children. I have been living in the US for over 8 years. I major in political science and minor in Philosophy at KU. This is my last semester and I am presently taking five classes. I decided to enroll in the KU bootcamp as a change in career to have better job opportunities.  I am hardworking, determined, focused, and a reliable team partner. I love soccer. I used to play in a division II club during my prime. At my leisure time, i watch sports, particularly soccer. I love fishing as well. I am an indoor person. I spend most of my time studying and playing with my kids. They are my treasure. Enrolling in this bootcamp has been a great challange to me especially as i still have five course to study in school. I have accepted the challange, and i know i'm equal to the task. I hope to find a better job after the completion of this bootcampt session. I am willing to relocate if i find a better job opportunity in any location, provided it's as safe as Overland Park.
